# GreenProof

GreenProof is an open-source ESG verification platform that cross-checks corporate sustainability disclosures against real operational data. It combines rule-based NLP claim extraction, real-time IoT sensor comparison, machine learning anomaly detection, and AI-powered analysis to identify inconsistencies in ESG reports automatically.

Built at Geminathon 2026, a 24-hour hackathon organized by the Code Y Gen Club at VIT Chennai, with support from Google Gemini, ElevenLabs, Major League Hacking, and YSOC.

## Overview

Most ESG scoring tools take company disclosures at face value. GreenProof verifies them by running a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Claim Extraction** — A rule-based NLP parser extracts ESG claims from uploaded PDF reports and classifies them as quantitative, future target, comparative, or general. Mathematical consistency checks are applied where possible.
2. **IoT Cross-Verification** — Extracted claims are compared against live facility-level sensor data (CO2 emissions, energy consumption, water usage, waste generation) streamed in real time via WebSocket.
3. **Anomaly Detection** — A custom Isolation Forest model evaluates company metrics against industry norms and flags statistically anomalous patterns that may indicate greenwashing.
4. **AI Analysis** — Gemini 1.5 Flash performs structured discrepancy analysis between report claims and IoT data, assigning severity levels and confidence scores to each inconsistency.
5. **Industry Simulation** — A physics-based simulation engine lets users model operational changes and see their precise impact on ESG scores, emissions, and costs before implementation.
6. **Suggestion Generation** — Gemini generates prioritised improvement recommendations with estimated CO2 reduction, cost savings, and payback periods.
7. **Audit Trail** — Every verification run is stored in a SHA-256 hash chain, making historical records tamper-evident.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Python 3.11 or higher
- A Gemini API key from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/greenproof.git
cd greenproof
```

**2. Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

**3. Install frontend dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**4. Install Python dependencies**

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**5. Train the ML model**

Place the ESG dataset at `backend/data/esg_data.csv.csv`, then run:

```bash
cd backend
python train_model.py
```

This generates `backend/models/integrity_model.pkl` and `backend/models/scaler.pkl`. This step is only required once. If the model files are absent, the system falls back to a rule-based integrity checker automatically.

**6. Start the Python backend**

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
# Listening at http://localhost:8000
```

**7. Start the frontend**

In a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# Listening at http://localhost:3000
```

## ML Model

The integrity checker uses a scikit-learn Isolation Forest trained on the following ESG signals:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| carbon_intensity | CO2 emissions divided by revenue ($M) |
| energy_intensity | Energy consumption divided by revenue ($M) |
| water_intensity | Water usage divided by revenue ($M) |
| ESG_Environmental | Environmental score (0-100) |
| ESG_Overall | Overall ESG score (0-100) |

Configuration: `n_estimators=100`, `contamination=0.07`, `random_state=42`. Features are normalised using StandardScaler prior to training and inference.

At inference the model returns an anomaly score, a binary suspicious flag, and a set of human-readable explanations identifying which intensity ratios triggered the flag.

## Roadmap

- Vision-based parsing for charts and infographics in PDF reports
- Historical ESG trend tracking per company
- PostgreSQL migration
- User authentication
- Fine-tuning Mistral 7B for ESG claim classification to remove third-party AI dependency
- Real IoT device integration via MQTT
- Multi-company comparison dashboard
- PDF export for verification reports
